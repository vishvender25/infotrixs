the above project is a contact management system made using python. We can keep a track of contacts add contacts delete contacts and search for contacts in the directory.

I used basic csv file properties to store the information of the contacts. For this we import the csv module and perform read , write operations on it accordingly.

1. view
   for this we just open the csv fil and traverse the data stored in the csv file in the form of and print the attributes accordingly.
2. create
   for this we input the name and mobile number of the user and add these attributes in a list and then use the writelines function of the csv module and push the details in
   the csv file.
3. delete
   for this we input the name of the contact the user wants to delete and traverse the csv file and the delete the user if the user is found we update the csv file accordingly
   by adding the contacts that need not to be deleted.
4. search
   for this we input the name the user wants to search and search the name in the csv file.
